CORBA Remote Streams Example
---------------------------

This sub-directory contains an example similar to the example code in
../test/java/examples/stream/, except that this example uses CORBA for the RPC
framework. 

There is an all java example in src/java/examples/iiop/ which is almost
exactly the same as the other java stream example with the exception that
the CORBA framework is used for all the remote communication.

In addition, there is a c++ test server example in the src/cpp directory.
The source files where created using omniORB 4.1.0 installed under
"/usr/local/omni".  The "main" class is RemoteFileServer_i.cc which mirrors
src/java/examples/iiop/TestServer.java.
